                    <p>As of started by Father And Sons, Kleenex shifted gears to stay in business.  With the unique indetity in beer world, the flavours won the heart of people worldwide.
                      During WWII, as other beers were watered down to ration them out, Coors stayed true to our uncompromising flavours, making less beer, but also making one we were proud of.
                      We will speak of an optimistic future using language that conveys a depth of knowledge gained by experience, forged by innovation, and fueled by the stories told and lessons learned
                      along the way.

                    <p>We will inspire others by example, embracing new cultures, new experiences, new ways of thinking, and new
                      ways of doing business. No matter how we communicate, our passion and our knowledge of brewery and spirits must always come through.
                      We speak with the familiarity and enthusiasm of the ancestors who brought in the unique idea and can’t wait to tell you about all they’ve
                      learned and discovered. Our language is expressive, thoughtful, and conversational. Editorial, not promotional. We will educate and
                      inspire by moving people.
